In the face of increasing operational costs and the significant economic impact of flight delays, this project aims to dissect and understand the dynamics of aircraft delays using the "flights.csv" dataset. The objective is to analyze detailed flight data recorded in the dataset to discern patterns, causes, and consequences of delays across various U.S. airlines, including major carriers like Southwest and Virgin America.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this research is to leverage the "flights.csv" dataset to:

Identify and analyze patterns of flight delays among different airlines.
Explore broad trends and seasonal variations in flight delays.
Evaluate the performance impact of these delays on airline operations.
By understanding these patterns, we aim to contribute to strategies that could mitigate the rising costs associated with airline delays.

Methodology
Utilizing Hadoop and Spark for data processing, this project involves:

Data ingestion and preprocessing using Hadoop.
Detailed data analysis and pattern recognition using Spark to handle large-scale data efficiently.
Visualization of findings to illustrate trends, seasonalities, and airline performance metrics.
Scope
The focus is particularly on:

Seasonal trends that affect flight timings.
Airline-specific delay patterns.
Operational impacts and their correlation with delay causes.
Expected Outcomes
Through this analysis, the aim is to provide actionable insights that airlines can use to:

Improve operational efficiencies.
Reduce costs associated with delays.
Enhance overall customer satisfaction by reducing wait times and unpredictability.
